24,Love is King Necklace,68.44,"You learn the neatest things in this job.

Beyond that, it's hard to establish provenance, so we're just going to go back 375 years, if that's okay with you.ÿSo now you know what the back of this Love is King Necklace set looks like. The front is a heart pierced with a sword. The trick is that the two separate. The heart hangs from a satin ribbon. The sword hangs from a black chain. One pendant for you.

25,Coeur Sauvage Necklace Pendant,71,"You've probably seen commercials for the new ""Hearts On Fire"" diamond, which is a cutting technique that makes gems even more insanely sparkly than they already are.

And we could grant them ""on fire"" if you're going to do science with your diamond to refract the light to a single point. Which we can totally see you doing.ÿBut there's a simpler way to set a heart on fire, and it's this: dragons. This necklace portrays a light and dark dragon, tails entwined, a red Swarovski crystal (read: super-sparkly) heart held between them. Hanging from a 21"" split chain, the pendant represents the joining of two into one, the duality of nature, the feeling of elation like flight that you have when you're in love, and, uh, dragons. Because they're awesome.",nosize,fun stuff
