# Nile E-Commerce Python Coding Challenge

## Executive Summary:

Nile E-Commerce was a fun Python coding challenge!  It included many assumptions and functional requirements that were a challenge to include in my code.  (View the PDF for the full list.)  Once I had my code written, I enjoyed testing it and trying to break it, to determine what areas of my code I needed to revise or enhance.    


### Business Problem: 

Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon, has left Amazon to start a new e-commerce site that will be a direct competitor with Amazon but for a niche market - people who work with and/or love technology.  He is calling it Nile (yes, another famous river).  He plans to sell items from these categories: shirts, pants, sweaters, jewelry, and fun stuff.  However, Jeff needs help building the Nile shopping platform.  My task was to create the Nile e-commerce shopping experience, abiding by various assumptions and functional requirements, using Python programming.       


### Methodology: 

1. Understand the business problem, assumptions, and functional requirements.
   
2. Read in Accounts and Products Data.  Undertand this data.    

3. Sort products by type and item.  Count orders of each product to understand product popularity.  

4. Created functions for the login, shopping, ordering, and checkout processes.

7. Provide a checkout summary that notes which most popular items are purchased.

8. Authorize credit card details.

9. Write understandable messages and instructions for user to navigate the site.

10. Broke the deliverables and project requirements into smaller coding tasks.  Coded each smaller task, then worked on connecting them together.

11. Run and test code, identifying problems and flaws.


### Requirements: 
- Read in product and account data from .txt files
  
- Store product and account information in the program
  
- Verify account existence using login criteria

- Lock out users after two incorrect login attempts

- Create new accounts using an account object holding account information

- Display product categories and items

- Ask the user to select the product category and item, accounting for case and spelling errors

- Manage and track item quantities in inventory

- Display out of stock message when needed

- Allow purchasing item multiples if enough stock

- Repeat the process until order is complete

- Display order summary 

- Perform credit card authorization function to randomly generate authorization 

- Update account purchase history

- Identify the most popular items purchased

- Suggest other items based on similar purchasing habits


### Skills:

Python: Reading in and storing data, Writing functions, Data structures, Appending lists, Dictionaries, Objects, Tuples, For loops, Statistics, Code commenting, Code formatting, Code testing


### Results & Business Recommendation: 

I created an initial code framework for the Nile E-Commerce site.  By developing the site, customers are now able to shop online, saving the catalog and phone order team hours of customer purchase requests per week.  

The site's code framework is very rudimentary and lacks features, which could create bugs or deficits that frustrate customers.  Working to build out the site with more product details and a smoother user experience could increase sales.    

The biggest sales impacts will likely come from increasing product information, which could lead to decreased returns and increased order volume, and an easy user shopping experience, which could lead to a higher volume of repeat customers.  I recommend the following three enhancements as priority next steps.  


### Next Steps: 

1. Since there are no photos of the items, add string fields fully describing each item.  This is also a value-adding accessibility feature!  
2. Enhance user account functionality to allow potential new users to browse items without needing a login.  Requiring a user login to view the products is a barrier that could deter potential new customers, frustrate current customers who've lost their login, and reduce sales.
3. Allow for personalization of each item with custom text entered by the user at the time of order.  Limit customization to a length appropriate for the size of the item.
