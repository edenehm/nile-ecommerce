# Nile E-Commerce Python Coding Challenge

## Executive Summary:

Nile E-Commerce was a fun Python coding challenge!  It included many assumptions and functional requirements that were a challenge to include in my code.  (View the PDF for the full list.)  Once I had my code written, I enjoyed testing it and trying to break it, to determine what areas of my code I needed to revise or enhance.    


### Business Problem: 

Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon, has left Amazon to start a new e-commerce site that will be a direct competitor with Amazon but for a niche market - people who work with and/or love technology.  He is calling it Nile (yes, another famous river).  He plans to sell items from these categories: shirts, pants, sweaters, jewelry, and fun stuff.  However, Jeff needs help building the Nile shopping platform from scratch using Python.   


### Methodology: 

1. Understand the business problem, assumptions, and functional requirements.
   
2. Read in Accounts and Products Data.  

3. Sort products by type and item.  Count orders of each product to understand product popularity.  

4. Build login interface to welcome existing users or prompt new users to create an account.  Grant users with an account access to the site or deny access after 2 unsuccessful login attempts.

5. Allow users to pick a category, display items, and shop within that category.  Limit adding to cart to in-stock quantities of each item.

6. Build cart, count items, and total cost.  Allow users to keep shopping, review and edit their cart, or proceed to checkout.

7. Provide a checkout summary that notes which most popular items are purchased.

8. Authorize credit card details.

9. Write understandable messages and instructions for user to navigate the site.  


### Skills:

Python: Reading in and storing data, Writing functions, Data structures, Appending lists, Dictionaries, Objects, Tuples, For loops, Statistics, Code commenting, Code formatting, Code testing


### Results & Business Recommendation: 

I created an initial code framework for the Nile E-Commerce site.  By developing the site, customers are now able to shop online, saving the catalog and phone order team hours of customer purchase requests per week.  

The site's code framework is very rudimentary and lacks features, which could create bugs or deficits that frustrate customers.  Working to build out the site with more product details and a smoother user experience could increase sales.    

The biggest sales impacts will likely come from increasing product information, which could lead to decreased returns and increased order volume, and an easy user shopping experience, which could lead to a higher volume of repeat customers.  I recommend the following three enhancements as priority next steps.  


### Next Steps: 

1. Since there are no photos of the items, add string fields fully describing each item.  This is also a value-adding accessibility feature!  
2. Enhance user account functionality to allow potential new users to browse items without needing a login.  Requiring a user login to view the products is a barrier that could deter potential new customers, frustrate current customers who've lost their login, and reduce sales.
3. Allow for personalization of each item with custom text entered by the user at the time of order.  Limit customization to a length appropriate for the size of the item.
